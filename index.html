        <h2 id="camera">Samsung 600MP Camera</h2>
        <h6>April 28, 2020 08:17AM</h6>
        
        <p>Samsung has said that it is working on camera sensor that has resolution as high as 600 MP. The South Korean tech giant said that the sensor can capture more detail than the human eye.<br></p>

<p><em>“Through relentless innovation, we are determined to open up endless possibilities in pixel technologies that might even deliver image sensors that can capture more detail than the human eye,”</em> Yongin Park, Head of Sensor Business Team at Samsung, said in a company blog.<br></p>

 <p>Samsung aims to develop a 600 MP camera sensor that it claims will capture more detail than the human eye.<br>
Samsung is also working on other types of sensors that can register smells or tastes.<br></p>

<p>He said that most available cameras can only capture images that are visible to the human eye at wavelengths between 450 and 750 nanometers. Sensors to detect light wavelengths outside of the range are hard to come by.<br></p>

<p>Park said that a human eye is said to match a resolution of around 500 MP. Most flagship DSLR cameras and smartphones offer 40 MP and 12 MP resolution.<br></p>

<p><em>“We as an industry still have a long way to go to be able to match human perception capabilities,”</em> Park said.<br></p>

<p>Samsung is not only developing image sensors, but is also working on other types of sensors that can register smells or tastes.<br></p>

<p><em>"Sensors that even go beyond human senses will soon become an integral part of our daily lives. We are excited by the potential such sensors have, to make the invisible visible and help people by going beyond what our own senses are capable of,"</em> Park added.</p>
 
 <h2 id="app">Arogya Setu App</h2>
 
 <p>Arogya Setu, the contact-tracing app which is the talk of the town and has gotten over 75 million downloads, recently exposed some users' data, including location data, to YouTube. The security bug came to light when the New York Times wrote about it. It has now been fixed, Aarogya Setu noted in a statement.</p>

<p>The app potentially exposed location data, including longitude and latitude, of a user in certain usage conditions. "Recently, Team Aarogya Setu was made aware that if a user performed a very specific set of actions, YouTube could access the anonymised latitude and longitude of the user," the statement by Aarogya Setu noted.</p>

<p>But it said that only the location data was revealed. No other data, and particularly no data that could have revealed the identity of a user, was leaked to YouTube.</p>

<p><em>"When a user filled a self-assessment in the app, and then immediately scrolled down to the YouTube iframe, a referral header containing latitude-longitude information with no other personal identifier was visible to Google,"</em> noted the app.</p>

<p>The statement said that the Aarogya Setu team identified the source of the vulnerability and fixed it at 4 AM on April 26.</p>

<p>Aarogya Setu has become one of the key tools for the government in its efforts to curb coronavirus infections in the country through contact-tracing. The government is making a lot of effort to popularise the app and has repeatedly asked Indians to download it on their phones. But there are privacy concerns as well, around the usage of the app.</p>

<p>Unlike the contact-tracing apps that many other countries are using, the Aarogya Setu app captures both Bluetooth and location data. Many other such apps, including the ones based on Google and Apple’s contact tracing technology, only use Bluetooth.</p>

<p>At the same time, there are reports that the government plans to use the Aarogya Setu app as an access control app through its e-pass feature, which is supposed to be rolled out soon. The e-pass feature is likely to grade people into Green, Orange and Red categories, with people with the Green e-pass getting access to all public areas, while people in Red and Orange will be asked to go in self-quarantine.</p>

<p>Recently, there was a report that the app will be used by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Delhi Metro to screen people who wish to use the service once lockdown is lifted. Also, recently Zomato and Urban Company made the app mandatory for their delivery and service executives.</p>

<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has lauded the Indian government for utilising technology in the fight for COVID-19.<em> "I’m glad (Indian) government is fully utilising its exceptional digital capabilities in its COVID-19 response and has launched the Aarogya Setu digital app for coronavirus tracking, contact tracing, and to connect people to health services,"</em> the Microsoft co-founder said in a letter. If you remember, Bill Gates is also a fan of India’s Aadhaar project and has praised it, although many experts believe Aadhaar too has privacy implications.</p>
